# Assumptions

- Target Godot version is 4.2+ with Forward+ renderer.
- Offline play is default and fully supported; online ladder is optional and off by default.
- Input bindings prioritize keyboard/controller compatibility. Mouse aiming is prepared for future enhancement.
- Placeholder geometry/materials are acceptable for MVP as long as loop is playable.
- Season 1 unlock threshold is set to 100 total local participants in config for future migration.
- Level cap in moment-to-moment gameplay is tuned for 20 in MVP, with data structures supporting 50.
- Anti-tamper signature in server is a development stub, not production crypto-hardening.
